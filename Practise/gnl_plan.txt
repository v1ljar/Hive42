Prototype:
	char    *get_next_line(int fd);

Allowed functions:
	read, free, malloc

Given is:
	-a file descriptor to a file

Logic:
	I need to read the file by size of BUFFER_SIZE and fill char str[BUFFER_SIZE + 1]
		- if '\n' not found in str:
				save str content to static buffer
		- if '\n' or '\0' is found in str:
				find the occurance pos and if occurance somewhere in the str, then:
					+ until the occurance data stored to the result for output, the rest to the static buffer
