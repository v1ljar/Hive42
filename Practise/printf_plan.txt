PRINTF

Prototype:
		int ft_printf(const char *, ... );

Allowed functions:
		malloc
		free
		write
		va_start
		va_arg
		va_copy
		va_end

Conversions to manage:
		s	(char string)
		d	(BASE10 intiger)
		x	(BASE16 hexadecimal)

I need to parse through the printf char* and if occurs '%' and after that is identifier,
then need to check the variadic argument and print on the screen the conversion of it.
