Welcome to my Hive42 Helsinki project repository! ðŸŽ“ðŸš€

My journey in Hive began in 2024 and this repository is a reflection of my growth, skills and accomplishments throughout the program.

Every challenge is an opportunity to grow, every line of code is written with purpose and resilience drives my learning process.

About Hive42 Helsinki

Hive Helsinki (part of the 42 Network) is an innovative and collaborative coding school that emphasizes peer learning, problem-solving and real-world projects. With a focus on C programming, algorithms, full-stack development and system architecture, the curriculum is designed to forge independent and highly skilled software engineers.

Repository Structure

This repository contains my projects from Hive42, categorized by their respective modules and difficulty levels:
     
ðŸ“‚ cub3d/ â€“ Graphical 3D (MLX42) project. Goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90's game "Wolfenstein 3D".
	   - Project state: Mandatory part done (101/100)

ðŸ“‚ ft_printf/ â€“ Recreating the famous printf function in C.
