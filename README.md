# Welcome to my **Hive42 Helsinki** project repository! ðŸŽ“ðŸš€

My journey in Hive began in 2024 and this repository is a reflection of my growth, skills and accomplishments throughout the program.
Every challenge is an opportunity to grow, every line of code is written with purpose and resilience drives my learning process.

## What is Hive42?

**Hive Helsinki (part of the 42 Network) is an innovative and collaborative coding school that emphasizes peer learning, problem-solving and real-world projects. With a focus on C programming, algorithms, full-stack development and system architecture, the curriculum is designed to forge independent and highly skilled software engineers.**

## List of my projects at Hive42(in process or finished):

**ðŸ“‚ CPP00/** - This first module of C++ is designed to help understand the specifities of the language when compared to C. Time to dive into Object Oriented Programming! **In progress**

**ðŸ“‚ cub3d/** â€“ Graphical 3D (MLX42) project. Goal is to make a dynamic view inside a maze, inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90's game "Wolfenstein 3D". **Mandatory part done (105/100)**

**ðŸ“‚ ft_printf/** â€“ Recreating the famous printf function in C. **Mandatory part done (100/100)**

**ðŸ“‚ get_next_line/** â€“ Efficient file reading and buffer handling in C. **Mandatory part done (100/100)**

**ðŸ“‚ libft/** â€“ A custom static C library project, implementing essential functions from the standard library. **Mandatory part done (122/125)**
               
**ðŸ“‚ minishell/** - The objective of this project is for you to create a simple shell. **Mandatory part done (101/100)**

**ðŸ“‚ minitalk/** â€“ A small data exchange program using UNIX signals. Introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects. **Mandatory part done (103/100)**

**ðŸ“‚ netPractice/** - NetPractice is a general practical exercise about networking, TCP/IP. **Mandatory part done (100/100)**

**ðŸ“‚ philosophers/** - Aims to teach concurrent programming, focusing on multithreading and multiprocessing. **Mandatory part done (100/100)**

**ðŸ“‚ push_swap/** â€“ An algorithmic challenge to sort a stack using the fewest moves. **Mandatory part done (96/100)**

**ðŸ“‚ so_long/** â€“ A basic 2D game (library used: MLX42) in which a hero escapes Matrix after collecting some knowledge. **Mandatory part done (104/100)** | Enemies added, at the moment hero is not able to kill dragons.
