The whole project has to be done in a virtual machine. Alpine or Debian.

Have to use docker compose.

You also have to write your own Dockerfiles, one per service. The Dockerfiles must be called in your docker-compose.yml by your Makefile.

You then have to set up:
• A Docker container that contains NGINX with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 only.
• A Docker container that contains WordPress + php-fpm (it must be installed and
	configured) only, without nginx.
• A Docker container that contains MariaDB only, without nginx.
• A volume that contains your WordPress database.
• A second volume that contains your WordPress website files.
• A docker-network that establishes the connection between your containers.
Your containers have to restart in case of a crash.
